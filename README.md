# Build your own Personal Package Archive (PPA) for OpenWRT in Gitlab

This script is using the OpenWRT SDK packaged into a Docker image, generated by this project https://github.com/zoobab/openwrtsdk . I am working on building and publishing all the docker images with each SDK with each platform, but Docker Hub disabled automated builds for open source projects.

Available docker images with the SDK:

https://hub.docker.com/r/zoobab/openwrtsdk/tags

This is an example of an helloworld project written in C++ (https://github.com/zoobab/openwrt_helloworld):

```
$ ./build.sh
Usage: $0 giturl package_name sdk_image
Example: $0 https://github.com/zoobab/openwrt_helloworld helloworld zoobab/openwrtsdk:21.02.0-rc4-sunxi-cortexa53
```

Where:

1. `https://github.com/zoobab/openwrt_helloworld` is the URL of the GIT repo containing the OpenWRT packages
2. `helloworld` is the directory name containing the OpenWRT Makefiles
3. `zoobab/openwrtsdk:21.02.0-rc4-sunxi-cortexa53` is the sdk_image being used
